            Burp's dashboard lets you control and monitor Burp's automated activity:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>

                You can monitor the progress of tasks that are running, and open the <a href="task-details.html">task details window</a> for an individual task, to see more information.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can pause and resume individual tasks, or all tasks together.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can reorder tasks by dragging them within the task list.
            </li>

                You can configure settings for <a href="task-execution-settings.html">how tasks are managed and executed</a>, by clicking the gear icon at the top of the Tasks panel.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can view the <a href="issue-activity.html">issue activity</a> from any audit tasks that are running, to see vulnerabilities being reported in real time.
            </li>
            <li>
                You can configure <a href="../scanning/live-scans.html">live scanning</a> by clicking the "New live task" button.

        </ul>
        <p>
            You can click the "pop-out" icon in the corner of each panel to show it as a separate window, so you can keep it visible while working in other areas of Burp Suite.
