        <h1>Using Burp Repeater</h1>
        <p>
            Burp Repeater is a simple tool for manually manipulating and reissuing individual HTTP requests, and analyzing the application&#39;s responses. You can use Repeater for all kinds of purposes, such as changing parameter values to test for input-based vulnerabilities, issuing requests in a specific sequence to test for logic flaws, and reissuing requests from <a href="../target/site-map/index.html#issues-view">Burp Scanner issues</a> to manually verify reported issues.
        </p>
        <h2 id="issuing-requests">Issuing requests</h2>
        <p>
            The main Repeater UI lets you work on multiple different requests simultaneously, each in its own tab. When you send requests to Repeater, each one is opened in its own numbered tab. Each tab contains the following items:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Controls to issue requests and navigate the request history. The target server to which the request will be sent is shown - you can click on the target details to change these.
            </li>
            <li>
                An <a href="../../functions/message-editor/index.html">HTTP message editor</a> containing the request to be issued. You can edit the request and reissue it over and over.
            </li>
            <li>
                An <a href="../../functions/message-editor/index.html">HTTP message editor</a> showing the response that was received from the last issued request.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The easiest way to start working with Repeater is to select the request you want to work on within another Burp tool (such as the <a href="../proxy/history.html">Proxy history</a> or Target <a href="../target/site-map/index.html">site map</a>), and use the &quot;Send to Repeater&quot; option on the context menu. This will create a new request tab in Repeater, and automatically populate the target details and request message editor with the relevant details. You can then modify and issue the request as required.
        </p>
        <p>
            When your request is ready to send, click the "Go" button to send it to the server. The response is displayed when this is received, together with the response length and a timer (in milliseconds). You can use the usual <a href="../../functions/message-editor/index.html">HTTP message editor</a> functions to help analyze the request and response messages, and carry out further actions.
        </p>
        <h2 id="request-history">Request history</h2>
        <p>
            Each Repeater tab maintains its own history of the requests that have been made within it. You can click the "&lt;" and "&gt;" buttons to navigate backwards and forwards through this history and view each request and response. You can also use the drop-down buttons to show a numbered list of adjacent items in the history, and quickly move to them. At any point in the history, you can edit and reissue the currently displayed request.
        </p>
        <h2 id="repeater-options">Repeater options</h2>
        <p>
            Burp Repeater has various <a href="options.html">options</a> that control its behavior, including automatic updating of the Content-Length header, unpacking of compressed content, and the following of redirections. You can access these options via the Repeater menu.
        </p>
        <h2 id="managing-request-tabs">Managing request tabs</h2>
        <p>
            You can easily manage Repeater's request tabs. You can:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Rename tabs by double-clicking the tab header.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reorder tabs by dragging them.
            </li>
            <li>
                Open a new tab by clicking on the right-most "..." tab.
            </li>
            <li>
                Close tabs by clicking the X button in the tab header.
            </li>
        </ul>
